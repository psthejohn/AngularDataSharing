This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

## Tasks to implement : 
I am Working on adding all these functionalities -->
This project will include everything starting from basic angular data sharing to using apis, Life cycle  hooks, Rxjs, NgRX, Template driven and Reactive Forms, Custom Pipes, Testting beds, Hooks, Lazy Loading, Resolvers, onPush change detection, @ViewChild vs @ContentChild, Dynamic components and ng-template, Directives, @host, @HostBindings, exportAs, State Management, Depenndency Injection and Zones and most importantly securities, routes guards and auth guards. :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
